# Lab #5: Random Pets üê∂üê±

Submitted by: **Brian Zhang**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Random Pet Parade** is an Android app that displays random images of pets, specifically dogs and cats, fetched from external APIs. Users can tap a button to load a new random pet image, alternating between dog and cat pictures.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üêïüêà‚Äç‚¨õüîÆ**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least two (2) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random** / **https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search**.

## Video Demo

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:

## Notes

- **API Integration:** Utilizes external APIs (Dog CEO's Dog API and The Cat API) to fetch random pet images, demonstrating how to work with JSON data in Android.
- **Asynchronous Networking:** Implements AsyncHttpClient for making network requests, highlighting asynchronous programming techniques for non-blocking operations.
- **Image Loading:** Uses Glide for efficient image loading and display within the app, showcasing the use of third-party libraries for improved performance and user experience.
- **UI Interaction:** Features a user interface with a button that triggers the loading of new pet images, exemplifying basic UI element interactions in Android development.
- **Random Selection Logic:** Incorporates a simple random selection mechanism to alternate between dog and cat images, demonstrating basic logic implementation in app functionality.
